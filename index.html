                <h4>Abstact</h4>
                <p>Listening is fundamental to music practices and provides technical and cultural context to the design of musical instruments. Through various entanglement theories of human-technology relations, we can understand listening as a Baradian apparatus that motivates, propels, and evaluates the design of new musical instruments. Further, we can use listening practices as a method to de-center the human. We propose a workshop primed by emerging theories in sound studies to critically examine how listening appears, how it functions, and how it performs. Through guided mediations, hands-on exercises, and prompted discussion, we aim to integrate a plurality of listening experiences and suggest tuning our listening toward more entangled design practices.</p>

                <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening practices, with or without technology, can actively shape and reshape imaginations, memories, and intra-actions with the world [10, 16]</li>
                    <li>Listening as an apparatus presents an entangled subjectivity through an ongoing correspondence of thinking and doing with the material world [12]. This attentional disposition demonstrates an ambiguity between making music, exploring sound, and designing musical instruments.</li>
                    <li>A tracing of accountabilities and responsibilities in designing musical instruments and building listening machines can begin to formulate in considering both an interdependency of beings and things in how sound is produced and a plurality of aural abilities in how sound is perceived [4].</li>

                <h4>Ethical Standards</h4>
                <p>This workshop builds in part on listening technologies developed by organisers Robson and McPherson for earlier studies which were reviewed and approved by the research ethics board at QMUL. All technologies will be tested for safety including safe listening levels, prior to arrival at the workshop. This workshop takes inspiration from the concept of Aural Diversity [4] which rejects a single normative notion of human hearing in favour of a broad spectrum of human and nonhuman ways of hearing. However, none of the four human organisers of this workshop are d/Deaf or significantly hearing impaired, even as our aural experiences may differ. We do not seek to use this workshop to advance a solutionist agenda toward disability or any other way of being, but instead seek to raise more general questions about what listening might mean in different contexts.</p>
