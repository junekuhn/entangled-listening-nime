                <h4>Abstact</h4>
                <p>Listening is fundamental to music practices and provides technical and cultural context to the design of musical instruments. Through various entanglement theories of human-technology relations, we can understand listening as a Baradian apparatus that motivates, propels, and evaluates the design of new musical instruments. Further, we can use listening practices as a method to de-center the human. We propose a workshop primed by emerging theories in sound studies to critically examine how listening appears, how it functions, and how it performs. Through guided mediations, hands-on exercises, and prompted discussion, we aim to integrate a plurality of listening experiences and suggest tuning our listening toward more entangled design practices.</p>

                <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening practices, with or without technology, can actively shape and reshape imaginations, memories, and intra-actions with the world [10, 16]</li>
                    <li>Listening as an apparatus presents an entangled subjectivity through an ongoing correspondence of thinking and doing with the material world [12]. This attentional disposition demonstrates an ambiguity between making music, exploring sound, and designing musical instruments.</li>
                    <li>A tracing of accountabilities and responsibilities in designing musical instruments and building listening machines can begin to formulate in considering both an interdependency of beings and things in how sound is produced and a plurality of aural abilities in how sound is perceived [4].</li>
