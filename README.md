# Entangled Listening


Concepts weâ€™re exploring in the workshop
Listening practices, with or without technology, can actively shape and reshape imaginations, memories, and interactions with the world.
Working with certain audio technologies demonstrates an ambiguity between making music, exploring sound, and designing musical instruments.
A tracing of accountabilities and responsibilities in designing musical instruments and working with machine listening can begin to formulate in considering how sound is produced and how sound is perceived. 

Using a host of activities, from graphic and textual scores to mediated discussion, we aim to have a productive conversation about aural diversity and what that means for design. What felt easy to communicate? What felt really difficult to translate as a somatic or listening experience? If you are someone who has a disability in hearing or mobility, what are ways that people in this room can better accommodate your experiences?
